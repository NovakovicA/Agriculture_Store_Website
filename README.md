Homework for course Programming of Internet Applications.
Website made in MEAN stack which has three types of users - administrators, farmers and companies that sell plants/sprays that increase the plant growth.
Companies have different products that they sell and deliver to farmers using couriers that use Distance API to calculate distance between place of the company and the farmers farm.
Farmers have multiple farms that they can add, with a specified number of plant spots. Plant can be planted and it grows over time and by using the spray it increases plant growth by an amount of time. Farmers have an online store where they can make orders with multiple products from a same company (if they're available for purchasing).
Farmers can also regulate temperature (C) and water for the farm (L). Companies also have statistical graphs with information of the number of orders in last month.
There are also special pages for logging, registration and changing your password.

A more detailed description of the project can be found the pdf file (in Serbian).
